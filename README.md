# Python Project: Payment Trends & Invoice Analysis

## Project Overview

This Python project focuses on analyzing and visualizing payment and invoice data to provide insights into membership payment trends. It includes data cleansing, identifying members with repeated payment issues, and analyzing unpaid invoices by age group and team. Visualizations are created using Matplotlib to aid in understanding the data.

## Features

- **Visualize Payment Trends:** Use Matplotlib to create clear visualizations of payment patterns over time.
- **Identify Members with Repeated Payment Issues:** Analyze payment records to find members who have consistently delayed or missed payments.
- **Unpaid Invoices Analysis:** Break down unpaid invoices by age group and team for targeted insights.
- **Data Cleansing:** Includes Python code to clean and preprocess raw data for accurate analysis.

## How to Use

1. Prepare your data files (e.g., CSV or Excel) containing membership payment and invoice information.
2. Run the data cleansing script to clean and format the data.
3. Use the analysis scripts to identify repeated payment issues and analyze unpaid invoices.
4. Generate visualizations with Matplotlib to observe payment trends.
5. Modify parameters or datasets as needed to explore different aspects of the data.
